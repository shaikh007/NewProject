The first half of the last decade of the 20th century saw the launch of various car models like the Zen and the Esteem. In the year 1998, the company brought out a new version of the Maruti 800. Until 2004, the Maruti 800 was India’s best-selling car for nearly two decades. The Maruti Alto gained this distinction in 2004. The year 2005 saw the launch of Maruti Suzuki Swift, a five-door hatchback. In February 2012, Maruti Suzuki achieved the distinction of selling 10 million vehicles in India. Within 3 years, the 15 millionth vehicle rolled out in the form of a Swift Dzire in May 2015.</p>
